# how do i set up development environment
Please follow steps described in [setup.pptx](./setup/setup.pptx) to set up your development environment.
Note that failing to execute any of these steps may be ground for failure to complete this lab.

# i cannot generate bitstream
# my DDR board failed to execute correctly
I suggest doing the following:
1. make sure that your mips processor implementation is correct and pass simulation test(my impl seems correct);
2. try to fix as much warnings given by Vivado as possible;
3. if you believe your IO implemetation is correct, try starting a new project and try again;
4. open an issue and seek help.
